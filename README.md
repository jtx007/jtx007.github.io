# My Personal Website

This is my personal website built from scratch with React and HTML/CSS. It is currently deployed via github pages right at this link [here](https://jamesjacobthomas.com/), so feel free to check it out.

If being run locally, just run the following commands in your terminal

```npm install```

```npm start```

If you have any feedback or tips, please email me at jamesjacobthomas7@gmail.com, I would greatly appreciate it
